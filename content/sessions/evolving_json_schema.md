In this talk, I’ll share a candid update on the evolution of JSON Schema—what’s working, what’s missing, and where we’re headed next. Drawing from my experience leading community coordination and engagement, I’ll reflect on the milestones we’ve reached, the challenges we’re tackling, and how collaboration continues to shape the project’s growth. From tooling updates to community-driven initiatives, this session highlights how we’re building a more resilient, inclusive ecosystem, and why every contributor’s participation matters in shaping the next chapter of JSON Schema.
