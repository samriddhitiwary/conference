This talk will explore how we used JSON Schema to harden the API of our IoT connectivity solution, Notecard.

We'll dive into the practical implementation of schema-driven development: enforcing request validation, helping users catch integration errors before they reach production, and automatically generating documentation that stays in sync with the API. You'll see real examples of how JSON Schema transformed our development process, across our Notecard CLI, Developer Docs, programmatic SDK generation and MCP server.

Learn the patterns we discovered for building robust IoT APIs, the tools that made implementation seamless, and how this approach reduced the complexity in both maintaining our hardware API and explaining it to users.
