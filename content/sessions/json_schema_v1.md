A common question we hear from JSON Schema users is, when is JSON Schema going to be done? They're concerned that using something called a "draft" is risky and they're frustrated by how many versions of JSON Schema they need to know or support. The next version of JSON Schema, which we're calling "v1", aims to address those concerns. We're overhauling how we make changes and evolve JSON Schema so users can be confident that any updates won't break their schemas and they don't have to change their schemas to start using new features. In this talk, we'll cover a brief history of the evolution of JSON Schema, how that's going to change going forward, how those changes will affect how you manage your schemas, and what changes you can initially expect from the v1 release.
