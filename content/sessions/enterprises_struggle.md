For the past year, I've been working full-time in the 
JSON Schema ecosystem through my company 
Sourcemeta, partnering with enterprises to solve 
their most challenging schema problems. This hands-on 
experience has given me a unique perspective on where 
JSON Schema adoption breaks down at scale—from
tooling limitations and governance challenges to 
organisational resistance and performance 
bottlenecks. In this talk, I'll share my pulse on the 
ecosystem, what I’m doing to fix it, and what the 
JSON Schema tooling of the future could look like.
